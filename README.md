# hash-compare
Compare file lists generated with 'hashdeep' (https://github.com/jessek/hashdeep).

hash-compare finds matches in (independently generated) lists of files from hashdeep.
Use the tool to find matching files without the need to search filesystems multiple times (very useful with large amounts of data, such as video archives).
<br>
Only requirement (of course): The hash function (used with hashdeep) has to match. Otherwise there won't be useful results.
